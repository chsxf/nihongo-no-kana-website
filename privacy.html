<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<p><strong>Nihongo no Kana</strong> is an app that helps you to start learning the japanese language.
The app is free and done on a voluntary basis. This is not a commercial product.
The presense of ads in the app makes it possible to finance the annual costs of web hosting and distribution through the App Store.</p>

<p><strong>Therefore, the app does not store any personal information.</strong></p>

<p>However, in order to facilitate the development of the app, we use third party services from Google that may save some of your personal information. Those services may give orientation for future developments and for some fixes.</p>

<p>Those services are:</p>

<p><strong>Google Analytics</strong> (on the present website and inside the app), in order to collect information on how the app and the website are browsed and used.</p>

<p><strong>Google Admob</strong> (inside the app only), in order to display ads.</p>

<p>You can access the privacy policy for these two services at this address:<br /><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></p>

<p><strong>Do Not Track</strong></p>

<p>We respect your choice. If you have enabled the Do-Not-Track feature of your web browser, no tracking information will be saved on the website.</p>
